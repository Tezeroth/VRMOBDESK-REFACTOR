## Technical Approach

### Network Architecture

- **WebRTC for Peer-to-Peer**: Direct connections between clients for low latency

### Synchronization Strategy

- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between network updates

- **Ownership Transfer**: Dynamic transfer of object authority
- **Delta Compression**: Only sending changes rather than full state
- **Priority-Based Updates**: More frequent updates for important/nearby entities
- **Object Versioning**: Timestamp or version-based conflict resolution
- **Interest Management**: Focus network resources on relevant entities

### Implementation Phases

## Integration with Existing Systems

The multiplayer implementation will integrate with these existing components:

1. **Physics System**: Synchronized with the PhysX implementation
2. **Interaction System**: Hooks into the existing object interaction framework
3. **Avatar System**: Research the best way to integrate avatars, and implement.
4. **Audio System**: Extends the current audio implementation with spatial features
5. **UI System**: Integrates with the existing UI framework

## Success Criteria

The multiplayer implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can reliably connect to shared sessions
2. Player movements and interactions are synchronized with minimal latency
3. Voice communication is clear and properly positioned in 3D space
4. The system can support at least 5 simultaneous users without performance issues
5. The user experience is intuitive and requires minimal setup
6. The implementation works consistently across desktop, mobile, and VR platforms
7. Performance remains acceptable on Quest and low-end mobile devices

## Technical Constraints

1. Must work in modern browsers without plugins
2. Must function across NATs and firewalls when possible
3. Must degrade gracefully when ideal conditions aren't available
4. Must maintain acceptable frame rates on target devices
5. Must work with the existing A-Frame/Three.js architecture
6. Must scale down appropriately for mobile and Quest devices

## Scaling Considerations

For future scaling beyond the initial implementation:

1. **Voice Communication Scaling**
   - WebRTC direct connections work well up to ~10 users
   - For larger rooms, implement SFU servers (mediasoup, Janus, Jitsi's JVB)
   - Consider routing voice through a central low-latency server

2. **Physics and State Synchronization**
   - Implement spatial partitioning for large environments
   - Consider server authority for critical game state in larger deployments
   - Use interest management to limit updates to relevant entities

3. **Performance Optimization for Mobile/Quest**
   - Implement adaptive LOD for avatars based on distance and device capability
   - Dynamically adjust physics settings based on device performance
   - Disable or simplify voice processing for distant users
   - Implement aggressive culling of non-essential network updates



## Conclusion

The recent code optimizations have established a solid foundation for implementing multiplayer functionality. The modular architecture, state management improvements, and performance optimizations will make it easier to add networking capabilities while maintaining good performance across all devices.

The jump system optimizations in particular have improved the reliability and performance of movement mechanics, which will be critical for smooth multiplayer synchronization. The vector pooling and optimized collision detection will help reduce the performance impact of network synchronization.

The next steps will involve:
1. Researching cost-effective hosting options for the signaling server
2. Implementing the WebRTC connection layer
3. Setting up state synchronization for player movement and interactions
4. Adding positional audio support for voice chat
5. Creating a basic avatar system for player representation

These steps will be detailed in a separate multiplayer implementation plan once the research phase is complete.
