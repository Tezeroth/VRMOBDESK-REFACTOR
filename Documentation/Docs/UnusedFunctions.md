# VRMOBDESK Unused Functions

This document identifies functions and code segments that appear to be unused or commented out in the VRMOBDESK application.

## 1. Commented Out Code in MOBDESK.js

### Disabled Look Controls in enableGyro/disableGyro

```javascript
enableGyro() {
  this.gyroEnabled = true;
  // Optional: Could try explicitly disabling look-controls internal updates here if needed
  // const lookControls = document.querySelector('#camera')?.components['look-controls'];
  // if (lookControls) lookControls.enabled = false; // Might disable pointer input too - needs care
},

disableGyro() {
  this.gyroEnabled = false;
  // Optional: Re-enable look-controls if disabled above
  // const lookControls = document.querySelector('#camera')?.components['look-controls'];
  // if (lookControls) lookControls.enabled = true;
}
```

**Purpose**: These commented sections were intended to explicitly disable/enable the look-controls component when switching between gyro and swipe modes.

**Why Unused**: The implementation likely found that manipulating the gyro input directly without disabling look-controls was sufficient, avoiding potential issues with disabling pointer input.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, these comments can be safely removed as they are just notes about an alternative approach.

## 2. Commented Out Mobile Collider Removal in control-manager.js

```javascript
/* 
console.log("Queueing collider removal for mobile...");
// Delay removal slightly to ensure physics system is ready
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Executing delayed collider removal for mobile...");
    const colliders = this.sceneEl.querySelectorAll('.venue-collider');
    console.log(`Found ${colliders.length} venue colliders to remove physics from.`);
    colliders.forEach(collider => {
        if (collider.hasAttribute('physx-body')) {
            collider.removeAttribute('physx-body');
            // console.log(`Removed physx-body from ${collider.id || 'collider'}`);
        }
    });
     console.log("Delayed collider removal complete.");
}, 1000); // 1 second delay
*/
```

**Purpose**: This code was intended to remove physics colliders on mobile devices to improve performance.

**Why Unused**: The developers likely found that modern mobile devices can handle the physics colliders without significant performance issues, or they found a better optimization approach.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, this commented block can be safely removed.

## 3. Commented Out HTML in index.html

### Commented Out Script Tags

```html
<!--<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/c-frame/physx@v0.2.x/dist/physx.min.js"></script>


snow
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/c-frame/aframe-particle-system-component@1.2.0/dist/aframe-particle-system-component.min.js"></script>-->
```

**Purpose**: These script tags were for loading the PhysX library from CDN and a particle system component for snow effects.

**Why Unused**: The PhysX library is now loaded locally instead of from CDN, and the snow particle effect was likely removed or never fully implemented.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, these commented script tags can be safely removed.

### Commented Out AR-Related Attributes

```html
<!--
ar-cursor raycaster="objects: #my-ar-objects a-sphere .clickable, .blocker" --DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING
ar-hit-test="target:#my-ar-objects;type:footprint;footprintDepth:0.2;" --DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING
-->
```

**Purpose**: These attributes were intended for AR (Augmented Reality) functionality.

**Why Unused**: As noted in the comments, they "DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING", suggesting AR functionality was attempted but not fully implemented or needed.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, these commented attributes can be safely removed.

### Commented Out Button Event Listener

```html
<!-- Event listener for the button 
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const buttonEl = document.querySelector('#teleport-button');
    buttonEl.addEventListener('press', () => {
      window.location.href = 'https://tezeroth.github.io/wonderland-engine-hosting-test/';
      // or 'https://my-other-site.com'
    });
  });
</script>
-->
```

**Purpose**: This script was intended to add a JavaScript event listener for the teleport button to navigate to another website.

**Why Unused**: The navigation functionality was likely implemented using the `navigate-on-click` component instead, making this direct event listener unnecessary.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, this commented script can be safely removed.

## 4. Unused or Redundant Components in model-utils.js

### magnet-range-debug Component

```javascript
AFRAME.registerComponent('magnet-range-debug', {
  // Component implementation
});
```

**Purpose**: This component visualizes the range of magnetic interaction points for debugging.

**Why Unused**: This appears to be a debugging tool that is not used in the production environment. In the HTML, all instances of `magnet-range-debug` are commented out:

```html
<!--magnet-range-debug="range:0.2,0.1"-->
```

**Can Be Removed**: This component could be kept for development purposes but moved to a separate debugging file that is only included during development.

## 5. Unused Functions in VR.js

The VR.js file is very minimal and contains only one component and an empty DOMContentLoaded event listener:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  console.log("DOMContentLoaded");
  // ... existing code ...
});
```

**Purpose**: This event listener was likely intended to initialize VR-specific functionality when the DOM is loaded.

**Why Unused**: The comment "... existing code ..." suggests there was or should be code here, but it's currently empty.

**Can Be Removed**: The empty event listener can be safely removed if no initialization code is needed, or it should be filled with the necessary initialization code if required.

## 6. Redundant CSS Definitions in MOBDESK.css

There are several CSS class definitions that appear twice in the file:

```css
/* First definition */
.loading-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 9999;
  color: white;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Later in the file */
.loading-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 2em;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  z-index: 1000;
}
```

**Purpose**: These are styles for the loading overlay that appears while the application is loading.

**Why Redundant**: The second definition overrides the first, making the first definition unused.

**Can Be Removed**: One of the definitions should be removed, keeping the preferred styling.

## 7. Commented Out Merged Collider in index.html

```html
<!-- Single merged static collider - REVERTED -->
<!-- 
<a-gltf-model 
    id="merged-static-colliders" 
    src="#mergedcolliders-glb" 
    physx-body="type: static;" 
    make-transparent 
    position="0 0 0">
</a-gltf-model>
-->
```

**Purpose**: This was an attempt to use a single merged collider model for better performance.

**Why Unused**: As noted in the comment "REVERTED", this approach was tried but then reverted back to using individual colliders.

**Can Be Removed**: Yes, this commented code can be safely removed.

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Commented Code**: Most of the commented code can be safely removed to improve code readability.

2. **Consolidate CSS**: Remove redundant CSS definitions and consolidate styles.

3. **Clean Up Empty Event Listeners**: Either remove or implement the empty DOMContentLoaded event listener in VR.js.

4. **Move Debugging Components**: Move debugging components like `magnet-range-debug` to a separate file that is only included during development.

5. **Document Intentional Comments**: If any commented code is intentionally kept for future reference, add clear documentation explaining why it's kept and under what circumstances it might be used.
