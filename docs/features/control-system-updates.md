# Control System Updates

This document summarizes the recent updates to the control systems in the VRMOBDESK application.

## Jump Functionality

### Overview
Jump functionality has been added to allow users to navigate vertical obstacles in the virtual environment. The jump system supports multiple input methods:

- **Keyboard**: Spacebar key on desktop devices
- **VR Controllers**: A, B, X, Y, grip, or thumbstick press buttons on Oculus controllers
- **Mobile**: Dedicated jump button in the bottom right corner (or bottom left if using right-handed layout)

### Implementation
The jump functionality is implemented through the `JumpControl` component which handles:

- Jump physics and animations
- Input detection from multiple sources
- Collision detection during jumps
- Safe landing mechanics

For detailed documentation, see [Jump Functionality Documentation](jump-functionality.md) and [Jump State Machine](jump-state-machine.md).

## Mobile Controls Layout

### Overview
The mobile controls layout has been redesigned to improve usability and accommodate both left and right-handed users:

- **Movement Controls**: Arrow buttons for navigation
- **Action Buttons**: Grab/Throw and Examine/Cancel buttons for object interaction
- **Jump Button**: Dedicated button for jumping
- **Toggle Button**: Center button to switch between left and right-handed layouts

### Layout Options

#### Left-handed Layout (Default)
- Movement and action buttons: Bottom left in a compact 2-row grid
  - Top row: Grab/Throw, Up arrow, Examine/Cancel
  - Bottom row: Left arrow, Down arrow, Right arrow
- Jump button: Bottom right
- Toggle button: Center bottom

#### Right-handed Layout
- Movement and action buttons: Bottom right in a compact 2-row grid
  - Top row: Examine/Cancel, Up arrow, Grab/Throw
  - Bottom row: Right arrow, Down arrow, Left arrow
- Jump button: Bottom left
- Toggle button: Center bottom

### Implementation
The mobile controls are implemented through the `ArrowControls` component which:

- Creates and positions UI elements in a compact, ergonomic layout
- Handles touch interactions with visual feedback
- Manages layout toggling for left/right-handed users
- Integrates with movement, jump, and interaction systems

For detailed documentation, see [Mobile Controls Documentation](mobile-controls.md).

## Integration Between Systems

The updated control systems are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. **Device Detection**: Controls adapt based on the device type (desktop, mobile, VR)
2. **Input Handling**: Input from different sources (keyboard, touch, VR controllers) is processed consistently
3. **Movement Integration**: Jump functionality works with the existing movement system
4. **Physics Integration**: Jump and movement respect physics constraints and collisions

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the control systems include:

1. **Customizable Controls**: Allow users to customize button positions and sizes
2. **Advanced Jump Mechanics**: Variable jump height based on button press duration
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Add vibration feedback for mobile and VR controllers
4. **Gesture Controls**: Add support for swipe and pinch gestures on mobile
5. **Multiplayer Integration**: Ensure controls work seamlessly with upcoming multiplayer functionality
