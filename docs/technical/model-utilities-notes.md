# Model Utilities Notes

This document contains supplementary documentation for the model utilities in the VRMOBDESK application, focusing on:

1. Program functionality
2. Dependencies
3. Interactions
4. Program flow
5. Unused functions
6. Code optimization opportunities

## Model Utilities

The model utilities were originally contained in the `model-utils.js` file in the root directory. This file contained various utilities for working with 3D models, including:

1. **MakeTransparent**: A component that makes GLTF models completely transparent
2. **MagnetRangeDebug**: A component that visualizes the range of magnetic interaction points
3. **SimpleNavmeshConstraint**: A component that constrains an entity to a navigation mesh

These components have been moved to separate files in the `js/components` directory as part of the modular restructuring of the codebase:

- `js/components/MakeTransparent.js`
- `js/components/MagnetRangeDebug.js`
- `js/components/SimpleNavmeshConstraint.js`

However, the original `model-utils.js` file is still referenced by `index.html` as a temporary measure because the background A-Frame scene was from a boilerplate repository that didn't import 3D models and colliders correctly.

For detailed documentation on these components, see `docs/components/utility-components.md`.
