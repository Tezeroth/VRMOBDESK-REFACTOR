## WebRTC Implementation Checklist

### 1. Signaling Server Setup
- [ ] Create a new directory for the signaling server
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project with `npm init -y`
- [ ] Install required dependencies:
  - [ ] Express (`npm install express`)
  - [ ] Socket.io (`npm install socket.io`)
  - [ ] CORS middleware (`npm install cors`)
- [ ] Create `signaling-server.js` with the following functionality:
  - [ ] Set up Express server with CORS enabled
  - [ ] Initialize Socket.io
  - [ ] Implement room management logic
  - [ ] Handle user join/leave events
  - [ ] Implement WebRTC signaling (offer/answer/ICE candidates)
  - [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Test the signaling server locally
- [ ] Deploy the signaling server to a hosting service (Heroku, Glitch, etc.)

### 2. Client-Side WebRTC Implementation
- [ ] Add required libraries to the project:
  - [ ] Socket.io client
  - [ ] SimplePeer (or another WebRTC library)
- [ ] Update `MultiplayerManager.js` with WebRTC functionality:
  - [ ] Replace simulated connections with actual WebRTC connections
  - [ ] Implement connection to signaling server
  - [ ] Add peer connection establishment logic
  - [ ] Implement data channel creation and management
  - [ ] Add methods for sending/receiving data
  - [ ] Implement peer entity creation/management in the scene
  - [ ] Add position broadcasting
  - [ ] Implement error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Create UI for connection status and controls

### 3. Integration with PhysicsSyncManager
- [ ] Modify `PhysicsSyncManager.js` to work with the WebRTC implementation:
  - [ ] Update `sendMessageToPeer` method to use MultiplayerManager
  - [ ] Update `broadcastMessage` method to use MultiplayerManager
  - [ ] Ensure physics messages are properly routed between components
- [ ] Add event listeners for physics-related messages in MultiplayerManager
- [ ] Test physics synchronization between clients

### 4. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Create a test plan for multiplayer functionality
- [ ] Test connection establishment between multiple clients
- [ ] Test position synchronization
- [ ] Test physics object synchronization
- [ ] Add debug logging for network activity
- [ ] Implement network statistics display
- [ ] Test across different network conditions

### 5. Positional Audio Implementation
- [ ] Research WebRTC audio stream handling
- [ ] Implement audio stream capture and transmission
- [ ] Add spatial audio positioning based on peer locations
- [ ] Implement distance-based attenuation
- [ ] Add audio controls (mute/unmute, volume)
- [ ] Test audio quality and synchronization

### 6. Deployment and Optimization
- [ ] Set up TURN server for NAT traversal (or use a service)
- [ ] Optimize data transmission (compression, delta updates)
- [ ] Implement adaptive quality based on network conditions
- [ ] Add connection quality indicators
- [ ] Test on target devices (desktop, mobile, VR)
- [ ] Document deployment process

### 7. Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement input validation for all network messages
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent flooding
- [ ] Consider encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement basic authentication if needed
- [ ] Test for common security vulnerabilities

This checklist provides a detailed roadmap for implementing WebRTC-based multiplayer functionality in the VRMOBDESK application. Each section can be tackled sequentially, with testing performed at each stage to ensure proper functionality.
