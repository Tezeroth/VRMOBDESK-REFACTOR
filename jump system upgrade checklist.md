# Jump System Upgrade Checklist

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 1: Code Organization and Removal of Redundancy
- [x] Consolidate all debugging code
- [x] Remove redundant console.log statements
- [x] Create centralized debug logging function (with severity levels)
- [x] Make debug output toggleable (debug flag)
- [x] Remove dead/commented-out code
- [x] Remove unused functions and variables
- [x] Clean up leftover experimental/troubleshooting code
- [x] Group related state variables together
- [x] Add clear comments for each state variable
- [x] Ensure consistent naming conventions for all variables

## üßπ Phase 2: Refactor Core Functions
- [ ] Refactor Jump Initiation
  - [ ] Extract helper methods (validation, momentum calc, etc.)
  - [ ] Improve error handling + cover edge cases
- [ ] Refactor Wall Collision Handling
  - [ ] Extract wall collision logic into handleWallCollision
  - [ ] Simplify sliding vector calculation
- [ ] Refactor Landing Logic
  - [ ] Consolidate landing code into clear functions
  - [ ] Improve ground detection logic
  - [ ] Simplify safety checks

## üöÄ Phase 3: Optimize Performance
- [ ] Reduce raycasting overhead
  - [ ] Optimize number/frequency of raycasts
  - [ ] Cache raycast results where possible
  - [ ] Use object pooling for vectors
- [ ] Improve collision detection
  - [ ] Refine collision detection algorithm
  - [ ] Reduce check frequency smartly
  - [ ] Optimize wall/navmesh object queries
- [ ] Optimize animation handling
  - [ ] Streamline creation/removal of animations
  - [ ] Use more efficient animation techniques
  - [ ] Reduce redundant animation property settings

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 4: Improve Safety Mechanisms
- [ ] Consolidate all safety checks into a unified system
- [ ] Implement better fall-through-floor detection
- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for edge case fails
- [ ] Refine wall-floor junction detection and handling
- [ ] Add specific safety measures for problematic areas
- [ ] Implement robust position validation
- [ ] Add sanity checks for position updates
- [ ] Ensure consistent floor level tracking

## üìö Phase 5: Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive comments for every function
- [ ] Add section headers for major code blocks
- [ ] Explain complex algorithms/magic numbers
- [ ] Implement a configuration system
  - [ ] Move magic numbers into a config object
  - [ ] Add runtime config options
  - [ ] Create presets for different jump styles
- [ ] Add unit tests
  - [ ] Test critical functions
  - [ ] Cover known edge cases
  - [ ] Implement automated testing for regression

## üéØ Phase 6: Final Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Perform a full code review (style, consistency, redundancies)
- [ ] Verify all critical fixes are properly implemented
- [ ] Update JUMPTECH2.md with new implementation details
- [ ] Document all optimizations and improvements
- [ ] Add diagrams for complex interactions
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document common customization scenarios
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guidance

## üöÄ Implementation Rules
- Only make focused changes per commit
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Document every change and impact
- Maintain backward compatibility wherever possible
